I was born in Jinzhou in Liaoning province, which is a small city besides the sea. After 18 years living in my hometown, I  came to Huazhong University of Science & Technology (HUST) for undergraduate courses study. After four years' study in School of Electronics and Information Engineering, I got the BEng degree in 2013. And then I was recommended for admission to School of Mechanical Science and Engineering, HUST for PhD study, My supervisors are Prof. Yusheng Shi and Zhongwei Li. During my PhD study, I also worked with Prof. Yuhjin Chao at the University of South Carolina (UofSC) as a visiting student. After five years study, I obtained the PhD degree and the name of my dissertation is "Visual Computing Based Micro-nano scale 3D SEM Surface Measurement". Now, I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Advanced Micro and Nanosystems Laboratory (AMNL) in University of Toronto (UofT) supervised by Prof. Yu Sun. My main research interests are in the fields of Computer Vision and Micro-Nano Technology, In-situ industry inspection. Related topics include Micro-Nano Measurement, Calibration, 3D reconstruction, Digital Image Correlation, Structured Light, etc.
