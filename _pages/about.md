I am currently working as a postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/) and [Robotics Institute](https://robotics.utoronto.ca/) at University of Toronto, where I work on computer vision, 3D sensing and metrology, and robotics. I am a part of the [Advanced Micro and Nanosystems Laboratory (AMNL)](http://amnl.mie.utoronto.ca/), advised by [Prof. Yu Sun](https://sun.mie.utoronto.ca/bio/). 

I finished my PhD at [Huazhong University of Science & Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Yusheng Shi](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/shiyusheng/zh_CN/index.htm) & Zhongwei Li, and my undergraduate degree from same university, working with Prof. Yu Liu in Dian Group and SeedClass. 

My research focuses on 3D vision for robotics: 1) Develop 3D sensing/metrology techniques with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency, 2) Develop algorithms that can enable robot to learn manipulation skills necessary to execute manufacturing and medicine tasks.
