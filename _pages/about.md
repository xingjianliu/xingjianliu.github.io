I am an Associate Professor of [School of Mechanical Engineering](http://me.dlut.edu.cn/index.htm) at [Dalian University of Technology, DUT](http://en.dlut.edu.cn/). I study  computer vision, 3D sensing and metrology, and robotics.

Before joining DUT, I was a postdoctoral fellow at [Robotics Institute](https://robotics.utoronto.ca/), University of Toronto, working with [Prof. Yu Sun](https://sun.mie.utoronto.ca/bio/). I finished my PhD at [Huazhong University of Science & Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Yusheng Shi](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/shiyusheng/zh_CN/index.htm) & Zhongwei Li, and my undergraduate degree from same university, working with Prof. Yu Liu in Dian Group and SeedClass. During my PhD study, I also worked with [Prof. Yuhjin Chao](https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/faculty-staff/chao_yuh.php) at the [University of South Carolina (UofSC)](https://www.sc.edu/) as a visiting graduate student.

My research focuses on 3D vision for robotics: 1) Develop 3D sensing/metrology techniques with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency, 2) Develop algorithms that can enable robot to learn manipulation skills necessary to execute manufacturing and medicine tasks.
